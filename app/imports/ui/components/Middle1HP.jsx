                <hr/>
                The Green Energy Market Securitization Program (GEMS) is an innovative, sustainable green financing
                initiative designed by the Hawaii State Energy Office to make clean energy improvements more
                affordable and accessible for Hawaii consumers. The program provides low-cost capital to finance solar
                photovoltaic systems and other clean energy improvements for those who may otherwise have difficulty
                obtaining financing for these projects. Low-credit homeowners and renters, as well as nonprofits and
                small businesses are among those who will qualify for project financing through GEMS.
